# Pulse — Personal Time Strategist

## High-level Strategy and Goal
Pulse is a modern productivity app that goes beyond to-do lists: it acts as a personal
time strategist. It ranks tasks by a dynamic **Urgency Score** derived from deadline
proximity, estimated completion time, and priority — then proactively tells the user
*when* to start, not just *what* to do.

## Changes Implemented
- **Urgency Engine** (`src/shared/models/pulse.ts`): pure function `computeUrgency` returning score (0-100), level (chill/early/soon/now/overdue), optimal start time, and behind-schedule flag. Priority-weighted (Low/Medium/High/Critical). Covered by Jest tests.
- **Focus Scheduling**: `generateSessions` splits work into Pomodoro-style blocks anchored to the optimal start time.
- **Dashboard (`/`)**: stats, "Critical Today" section, urgency-sorted task list, overload warning when work exceeds available runway.
- **Tasks (`/tasks`)**: search, category filter, sort (urgency/deadline/newest), active + completed tabs.
- **Focus (`/focus`)**: session planner + live Pomodoro timer with work/break phases and progress ring. Logs completed minutes back to the task.
- **Settings (`/settings`)**: student/work mode switch, aggressive-alerts toggle.
- **Smart Task Input**: title, category, priority, deadline, estimated time (h/m), inline subtask builder, notes.
- **Adaptive Notifications** (`PulseNotifier`): in-app toasts for Start-Now, Falling-Behind, Optimal-Start (earlier window if aggressive alerts enabled). Evaluated every 30s, one fire per state per task.
- **Student / Work mode**: persisted per user, filters dashboard content and tailors category defaults.
- **Hardening pass**: API input validation via `src/shared/models/pulse-validation.ts` (title/deadline/priority/category/estimatedMinutes checks), focus timer now tracks completed work seconds across phase transitions and falls back to `createSession` when no pre-generated session exists, dashboard overload math uses the true deadline window (no 7-day cap), Smart Import coerces invalid AI fields to safe defaults, Tasks page persists filters to `localStorage`, notifications respect a new `notificationsEnabled` preference and properly treat overdue (`!isFinite(ratio)`) as falling behind, and AI account IDs are centralized in `src/config/ai-accounts.ts`. API-client mutations now propagate errors to callers so UI can show failure toasts.

## Architecture and Technical Decisions
- **Storage**: Postgres (Neon) with tables `pulse_tasks`, `pulse_subtasks`, `pulse_sessions`, `pulse_user_prefs`.
- **API**: REST routes under `src/app/api/{tasks, subtasks, sessions, prefs}`.
- **Client**: SWR for data fetching with 30s auto-refresh (acts as real-time approximation since SSE/WebSockets aren't available on this platform).
- **Shared model**: Urgency math lives in `src/shared/models/pulse.ts` so both API and UI use the same logic, and it is trivially unit-testable (pure functions, deterministic `now` parameter).
- **Validation shared module**: `src/shared/models/pulse-validation.ts` provides `validateTaskInput`, `validateTaskPatch`, `validateSubtaskTitle`. Used by all write endpoints and unit-tested alongside the urgency engine.
- **Zero-estimate tasks**: `computeUrgency` now handles `estimatedMinutes === 0` by scoring purely on priority + proximity (ratio returned as `NaN`). Overdue tasks still return `ratio: Infinity` with a capped score of 100.
- **Auth**: Single-org tool; dev mode uses a placeholder email. All data scoped by `user_email`.
